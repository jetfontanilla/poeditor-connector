poeditor-connector
===========

Connect javascript applications with [poeditor.com](https://poeditor.com) for easy internationalization support. 

Can be used to upload XMB message files generated from Angular2 i18n process and download translated XTB files suitable for bundling.

Install with npm through published version on [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poeditor-connector)

```sh
npm install poeditor-connector --save
```

### Requirements
Requires that you set up a project on [poeditor.com](https://poeditor.com) and generate an API key. Instructions are available on their [API reference](https://poeditor.com/api_reference)

### Angular i18n
This project was written specifically to connect an Angular typescript application to [poeditor.com](https://poeditor.com) for use with the XMB message format.

The [Angular documentation on i18n](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/i18n.html) focuses on the XLIFF format, but [poeditor.com](https://poeditor.com) only supports XMB. 
XMB is used heavily inside of Google, but is not well documented [externally](http://cldr.unicode.org/development/development-process/design-proposals/xmb).
Note that XMB is the file format for messageterms that have been extracted from the application. XTB is the related file format for the translation output that is actually bunded in the application. 

### Configuration
A sample config file is included in the project under config/poeditor.sample.json. This will need to be modified to support your preferred settings

* **apiToken** : poeditor.com api token
* **projectId** : poeditor.com projectId
* **importFile** : relative location of the terms to be posted to the api
* **importUpdating** : terms | terms_translations | translations
* **importLanguage** (optional) : the language code (required only if updating is terms_translations or translations)
* **importOverwrite** (optional) : set it to 1 if you want to overwrite translations
* **importSyncTerms** (optional) : whether or not to delete terms from the project not found in the import file when uploading
* **importFuzzyTrigger** (optional) : set it to 1 if you want to sync your terms (terms that are not found in the uploaded file will be deleted from project and the new ones added). Ignored if updating = translations.
* **importTags** (optional) : add tags to the project terms; available when updating terms or terms_translations; you can use the following keys: "all" - for the all the imported terms, "new" - for the terms which aren't already in the project, "obsolete" - for the terms which are in the project but not in the imported file and "overwritten_translations" - for the terms for which translations change
* **exportDir** : local directory to download translated files
* **exportFiles** : hash map of languages to download and the file name to use
* **exportFilters** (optional): filter results by 'translated', 'untranslated', 'fuzzy', 'not_fuzzy', 'automatic', 'not_automatic', 'proofread', 'not_proofread' (only available when Proofreading is set to "Yes" in Project Settings); you can use either a string for a single filter or a json array for one or multiple filter
* **exportTags** (optional): filter results by tags; you can use either a string for a single tag or a json array for one or multiple tags

```json
{
  "apiToken":"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_TOKEN",
  "projectId":"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  "importFile":"spec/messages.xmb",
  "importSyncTerms": 1,
  "exportDir":"locale",
  "exportFiles":{
    "en":"messages.en.xtb",
    "tl":"messages.tl.xtb",
